# React Tanstack - React Query

## React Query

- React Query is a library that helps you fetch, cache and update data in your React applications.

- React Query is often used to fetch data from an API and store it in a cache, so that the data can be used in multiple components without having to refetch it.

- React Query is built on top of the React Hooks API, and it provides a set of hooks that you can use to fetch and manage data in your React applications.

## Query vs Mutation

### Query

- A query is a request to fetch data from an API.

- A query is read-only, meaning that it does not modify the data on the server.

- A query is typically used to fetch data that is displayed in a component.

### Mutation

- A mutation is a request to modify data on the server.

- A mutation is typically used to create, update or delete data.

- A mutation is not read-only, meaning that it modifies the data on the server.
